# Automatic-Language-Identification
This project makes use of Mel Frequency Cepstral coefficients extracted from WAV files extracted from speech recordings to identify the language used by the Speaker.

## Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
The Mel Frequency cepstral coefficients are one of the best feature representations for speech signals. It is based on a cosine transform on the short term power spectrum of the signal.
